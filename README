                          =the embedded debugging Kit=


edKit is a set of tools to help debugging applications in embedded environments.

1- Building:
   1.1 - configuration

   For a simple configuration, just run the configure script:
   $> ./configure

   If cross-compilation is needed, then provide the type of the host where the
   binaries will be executed via the "host" option. for example on a mipsel
   target:
   $> ./configure --host=mipsel-linux-uclibc

   1.1- toolbox

   Toolbox is a set of classes used by all components. So it must be build
   before any other component.

   $> cd src/toolbox
   $> make

   1.2- edLeak

   edleak is the component that detects memory leaks. It is a shared library
   that must be preloaded in the target program.

   $> cd src/edleak
   $> make

2- Running:

   2.1- edleak

   To check memory leaks on "./my_target":

   $> LD_PRELOAD=edleak.so ./my_target

   Environment variables for configuration:
   - "edkit_fw_file": Set analysis filename (default is edleak.json)
   - "edkit_fw_period": Set slice dump period (default is 30s)

   If the target symbols names are not found by edleak, add "-export-dynamic" to
   the target linker options.

3- Analysing:

   3.1- html clients

   Html clients have been tested on opera, firefox, and chromium.
   Chromium must be run with the "allow-file-access-from-files" option:

   $> chromium-browser --allow-file-access-from-files

   3.2- edLeak

   - load "client/html/edleak/index.html" in your web browser.
   - load a json analysis file from the web interface.
   - watch the leaks.
