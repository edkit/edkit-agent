edKit is a set of tools to help debugging applications in embedded environments.

1- Building:
   1.1 - configuration

   Before compiling any component, configuration mus be selected. This is simply
   done creating a symbolic link of "build/arch.make" to the arch configuration
   file of your target. The default configuration is linux native host (i.e
   linux x86 in most situations). The "build/arch" directory contains some
   definitions for several targets. These can serve as example for other
   targets.

   1.1- toolbox
   
   Toolbox is a set of classes used by all components. So it must be build
   before any other component.

   $> cd src/toolbox
   $> make
  
   1.2- edLeak

   edleak is the component that detects memory leaks. It is a shared library
   that must be preloaded in the target program.

   $> cd src/edleak
   $> make

2- Running:

   2.1- edleak

   To check memory leaks on "./my_target":

   $> LD_PRELOAD=edleak.so ./my_target

   Environment variables for configuration:
   - "edkit_fw_file": Set analysis filename (default is edleak.json)
   - "edkit_fw_period": Set slice dump period (default is 30s)

3- Analysing:

   3.1- html clients

   Html clients have been tested on opera, firefox, and chromium.
   Chromium must be run with the "allow-file-access-from-files" option:

   $> chromium-browser --allow-file-access-from-files               

   3.2- edLeak

   - load "client/html/edleak/index.html" in your web browser.
   - load a json analysis file from the web interface.
   - watch the leaks.
